<META NAME="Description" CONTENT="This presentation confirms that the current understanding of space-time geometry is deficient and explains where and why. An integral account of the space-time continuum and its transformation to the quantum world is provided. In the course of its explanation the manner in which the fundamental forces of nature may be united is identified. Also shown is the origin of the breakup of the continuum into discrete quanta and of their interaction with the observer as cause for uncertainty in quantum trials. The unification of electromagnetism and gravity in a vector space that is fully consistent with the principles of Relativity will warrant the title of this presentation: Universal Reality.">

          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Inside 
            the space shuttle once it has attained orbit, the grasp of earth's 
            gravity largely cancels the very forces that tugged at you and kept 
            you pinned to the inside of the illusive sphere of the twirling carrousel. 
            More so these forces are perfectly cancelled for the centre of our 
            own minuscule gravity- let's call it our mind's eye and rely on our 
            skin and bones to keep the rest of us together. This mind's eye like 
            the intersection of cross-hairs in our camera's viewfinder has no 
            volume: it is an infinitely small point in space. A point that just 
            floats in space without direction or acceleration, unaware of the 
            speed that observers on the earth's surface confer on it. Of course 
            ground control would say that the shuttle and our mind's eye in it 
            are in a circular orbit around the earth. Yet neither speed nor the 
            curved path through space are directly measurable by us and we could 
            just as well dismiss the controllers' insistence that we are moving 
            on the basis of the observable fact that they are the ones who are 
            rotating on a sphere at some distance from us- in fact aren't they, 
            not us, the ones who are accelerated (by gravity). To further our 
            argument we could point out that the same would still be true had 
            mission control sent us in what it would have called the opposite 
            direction- in fact we could be going in any direction and with an 
            increased or decreased ground speed at any lower or higher altitude 
            and it still be all the same to us. And why not make the orbit that 
            the controllers on earth tell us about oval - if only earth would 
            not be in the way we could make the orbit increasingly more elliptical 
            and still not experience any movement. In fact if we would make the 
            furthest point of our ellipse so far that the earth appears as if 
            almost an infinitely small dot in space, we would find ourselves bobbing 
            back-and-forth along (almost) the same line or along however many 
            such lines of a different direction that we would care to choose.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Now 
            the point of all this is to demonstrate that our orbits could cover 
            all of space and yet it would be all the same point to our mind's 
            eye. The reason is that our mind's eye experiences no acceleration 
            that would indicate it is starting to move somewhere: it considers 
            itself at rest- it does not make any progress in its space no matter 
            how long- indefinitely and, long after our skin and bones have ceased 
            to exist, to eternity. Thus we could imagine any set of intersecting 
            orbits that are populated by a section of our mind's eye, yet since 
            none of these ever moves anywhere they would admit that at times in 
            their eternal persistence they experience a coincidence: a coincidence 
            not in space but in time only. In other words all space occupies just 
            one infinitely small point for all time: our mind's eye has achieved 
            a position from which the entire universe is observed as- wait …- 
            since there is no other space- as time, going in all directions: time 
            has the same three dimensions as space, and it not only appears likewise 
            but is no different from space for only the viewpoint of our observation 
            has changed. Of course, while time may look just like space, the things 
            in it such as the moon and stars would come to resemble the occasional 
            blurs that we remember from the disastrous carrousel ride. Incredibly 
            we have changed our viewpoint from the closed sphere of all possible 
            shuttle orbits that the ground controllers might observe, to one in 
            which we are the centre of the most complex motions that everything 
            else seems to undergo. A feat as if we had managed to turn an onion 
            the size of the universe inside-out. An inverted onion whose former 
            centre has become the outermost layer, while its skin is now nothing 
            more than part of that infinitesimal point that we let our mind's 
            eye occupy, all of space in our everyday universe compressed into 
            a single point for all time.</font></p>
