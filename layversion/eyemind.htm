<META NAME="Description" CONTENT="This presentation confirms that the current understanding of space-time geometry is deficient and explains where and why. An integral account of the space-time continuum and its transformation to the quantum world is provided. In the course of its explanation the manner in which the fundamental forces of nature may be united is identified. Also shown is the origin of the breakup of the continuum into discrete quanta and of their interaction with the observer as cause for uncertainty in quantum trials. The unification of electromagnetism and gravity in a vector space that is fully consistent with the principles of Relativity will warrant the title of this presentation: Universal Reality.">

          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font size="-1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Have 
            you ever woken up before your body has abandoned sleep? You lie in 
            a half-paralysed state yet the mind is crystal clear. Every day worries 
            will not disturb your inner peace, as solutions effortlessly appear 
            to dissolve previously insoluble problems. Your mind's eye, as if 
            no longer confined to your body, is but a point in its own space languishing 
            in a time stood still yet ballooned beyond the present. Then the first 
            stirring of morning brings back another reality, the bustle of daily 
            life with which you feel strangely at odds. In that transition you 
            know that while you are whole, the world beyond is but a smoke screen 
            covering disjointed beliefs and institutions. Soon a compulsion to 
            take up your regular routine and responsibilities takes over. Yet 
            a residual feeling remains that the world is not in harmony with … 
            they way things should be, if only you could figure out how: science 
            and religion are in disagreement over the most fundamental issues 
            of life, more often than not politics and the economy pursue cross 
            purposes, and society's bigotry strains your personal relationships. 
            Is such discord not a sign that all these separate realities are incomplete, 
            possibly flawed and but part of a greater reality? And that our further 
            progress may very well depend on our resolve to restore this dissonance 
            to harmony.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font size="-1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wide 
            ranging imaginative thoughts and inexplicable experiences have long 
            raised suspicion that indeed there is more to this world of ours than 
            meets the eye. However, speculation, faith and non-repeatable phenomena 
            provide no proof or explanation of a metaphysical world. Yet if a 
            transcending reality does exist then it will also offer a way to substantiate 
            it and, provided our science is not too far off the mark, it will 
            be possible with but minor revisions to describe it scientifically. 
            The presentation at this web site introduces just such a scientific 
            account of unifying some of these separate realities into a universal 
            greater reality. Its texts substantiate that indeed there are other 
            dimensions than the usual ones in which we spend our lives and its 
            main section provides the mathematical relations between our familiar 
            world and these newly recognised dimensions.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font size="-1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our 
            awareness does not reach beyond the <a href="../subtexts/stereoscopicvision.htm">three 
            spatial dimensions</a> we normally experience, because any extra-dimensional 
            perception does not appear to extend survival in our usual environment. 
            Hence, we lack the innate ability for regular perception of such other 
            unseen dimensions that, nevertheless, as related elsewhere at this 
            site are still just space and time. The questions that this revelation 
            raises are many, such as whether these other dimensions will make 
            it possible to cross the vast distances of space within a fraction 
            of a lifetime (defying the speed of light) if not travel through time 
            (of course we already travel through time, however, when we think 
            of time travel we mean a controlled leap to the past or future). Even 
            more profound, will we have an existence in these other dimensions 
            separate from the one in this physical world and so survive the death 
            of our body? In fact this web site introduces such a reality in which 
            we are both <a href="../popups/popobs.htm" target="popup">observers</a> 
            and actors whose role while coincident during our presence in this 
            world is otherwise detached from its mundane concerns and physical 
            manifestation. Accordingly, the answer to the above and many related 
            questions is that all these expectations may come true, except that 
            they will be realised in this larger universal reality that cannot 
            be readily understood in terms of the very limited sense of our present 
            fractured realities.</font></p>
