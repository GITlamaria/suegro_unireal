<META NAME="Description" CONTENT="This presentation confirms that the current understanding of space-time geometry is deficient and explains where and why. An integral account of the space-time continuum and its transformation to the quantum world is provided. In the course of its explanation the manner in which the fundamental forces of nature may be united is identified. Also shown is the origin of the breakup of the continuum into discrete quanta and of their interaction with the observer as cause for uncertainty in quantum trials. The unification of electromagnetism and gravity in a vector space that is fully consistent with the principles of Relativity will warrant the title of this presentation: Universal Reality.">

            'Foreword' in the main text infers that the understanding that underlies 
            this presentation was not the result of the usual 'bottom up' effort 
            but rather that of a 'top-down' delivery. The following explanation 
            is offered as an introduction to the nature and background to the 
            lifting of the oversights and accomplishment of unification of the 
            Relativity and Quantum theories.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font size="-1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
            unification of space-time geometry and the quantum world mentioned 
            above and detailed in the main text of this web site is supported 
            by relatively minor but essential extensions to mathematics and physics. 
            Yet these new concepts did not solely come about as a consequence 
            of philosophical deliberation and thought experiments. Unification 
            resulted as a natural byproduct of identifying and deconstructing 
            prevailing misconceptions using kind of a finished model as a guide 
            - not unlike cutting puzzle pieces from the picture on the box cover 
            such that they match the partially assembled fragments of the puzzle 
            on the table. This 'finished model' had 'come into my hands' as a 
            result of an experience that I had in the spring of 1979. At the time 
            I was asked if I would explain some aspect of electromagnetism- I 
            do not recall the actual question. Not long into my reply it occurred 
            to me that its conventional approach seemed more difficult to understand 
            than warranted and likely would lead to only more questions. I had 
            an intuition that a thought experiment involving 'a ride aboard an 
            electrical field' would lead to a clearer more expedient Relativistic 
            explanation. The informality of the situation had suppressed the fact 
            that Relativity offered no such explanation and soon I found myself 
            resorting to a line of reasoning that took me beyond the accepted 
            context of Relativity. It was this point of departure that as if triggered 
            a vision of how physical reality fit together and- in retrospect not 
            surprising as my expanded perception concerned what some had dubbed 
            the 'theory of everything'- engulfed me in an avalanche of its ramifications.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font size="-1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
            experience was instantaneous without forewarning and monumental, yet 
            I managed to finish my explanation without indication of what had 
            happened and without attracting queries over my unorthodox treatment 
            of the subject. However, it conferred on me what metaphorically I 
            have likened to a 'picture on the cover of a puzzle box'. I realised 
            that while complete, the picture as the case of a puzzle box cover 
            did not identify the shape of the pieces or the ones missing from 
            the puzzle of reality and its many parts that had already been assembled. 
            More specifically, its depiction of reality did not aim to provide 
            proof but to provide guidance to the task of completing the puzzle. 
            Since such undertaking would be a lengthy affair, I could not let 
            time dull the experience and therefore set out to capture it in words. 
            Having freed myself from the concentration that scientific proofs 
            demand, an impressionistic rendition held the promise of preserving 
            the essence and would let inspiration and faith in the integrity of 
            that inspiration lead the process. The resulting text could then be 
            a proxy for the understanding gained in the experience to serve as 
            a catalyst for reflections on this intractable subject and as a guide 
            to subsequent works with a more focussed objective or scientific purpose. 
            Nevertheless, the 'core' equations in the main text at the 'unireal' 
            web site were already included in the otherwise esoteric text of this 
            'catalyst' and their texts' parallels are unmistakable.</font></p>
