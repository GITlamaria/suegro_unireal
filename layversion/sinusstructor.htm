<META NAME="Description" CONTENT="This presentation confirms that the current understanding of space-time geometry is deficient and explains where and why. An integral account of the space-time continuum and its transformation to the quantum world is provided. In the course of its explanation the manner in which the fundamental forces of nature may be united is identified. Also shown is the origin of the breakup of the continuum into discrete quanta and of their interaction with the observer as cause for uncertainty in quantum trials. The unification of electromagnetism and gravity in a vector space that is fully consistent with the principles of Relativity will warrant the title of this presentation: Universal Reality.">

            act of observing an event involves space-time measurements in a known 
            setting- a frame of reference. Each measurement provides direction 
            and a measure for how far any event (i.e. a point on an Einstein interval 
            <a href="../popups/hyperbola.htm" target="popup">hyperbola</a>) is 
            from some agreed reference direction and common point of origin. In 
            mathematics the combination of direction and magnitude (a measure 
            of some quantity like length) are represented by what is called a 
            vector, in effect an arrow of a certain length and direction. Like 
            direction signs on a traffic pole, vectors can have a point in common 
            and provided they point in different directions in effect define the 
            angle between the surfaces on which they lie. Hence, a vector can 
            also be the line in which two surfaces intersect each other (i.e. 
            like the traffic pole to which the direction signs are connected and 
            where they in effect meet). It turns out that there is a way of connecting 
            the vectors representing the measurements of space and time mentioned 
            earlier, including the latter's newly identified dimensions, in a 
            diagram. The symmetrical geometric figure that results has eight surfaces- 
            a so-called octahedron, and is shown in the home page of this web 
            site. What makes the octahedron so interesting is that it derives 
            directly from the mathematical equations of Relativity (those defining 
            the Einstein interval and its so-called Lorentz transformations). 
            Its derivation and the fact that it can be constructed at all are 
            the result of explanations, presented at this web site, why attempts 
            to apply Relativity to the elementary objects that make up the material 
            world around us failed. A simple oversight became a formidable barrier 
            to finding the philosophical basis for measuring the space and time 
            components of elementary particles (called quanta) in such a way that 
            they be consistent with Relativity. </font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">The 
            cause for the mental block that has stymied efforts to advance Physics 
            has no easy parallel in our macroscopic world. Nevertheless, some 
            'alternate reality' video games may provide some sense of the trap 
            that science fell into. These games provide a visually simulated fantasy 
            world with which the player interacts through the monitor and manual 
            controls, e.g. the point-and-click of a computer mouse. However, no 
            other physical stimulation or queues such as movement, temperature 
            etc. are provided to enforce the player's sense of immersion into 
            the alternate reality of the game. With the benefit of the player's 
            knowledge of the real world on which the fantasy world is loosely 
            modelled, the mind's imagination compensates for the missing sensations. 
            Imagine what would happen if one were brought into the world the child 
            of deranged psychiatrists (no insinuation to demerit the field of 
            psychiatry is intended- it just happens to serve the present example). 
            Suppose these delusional parents had decided by way of experiment 
            to raise their child entirely in the fantasy world of such a video 
            game, with as only concession to the real world the provision of nutrients, 
            for excretion and mechanical stimulation for the child's physical 
            development. Lacking any other clues, the child would come to accept 
            the simulated world as its own and rationalise everything in it to 
            be consistent with the limits of its confines. The correlation of 
            hand movements of the mouse with motion on the screen would likely 
            present a conceptual problem not unlike that posed by the Relativity 
            and Quantum theories: the connection between the two would be inaccessible. 
            Obviously, neither the action on the screen nor of the computer mouse 
            can be associated with activities and their effect that the child 
            does not know such as real motion and acceleration when walking or 
            jumping.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">It 
            may be appreciated that under these circumstances it would be difficult 
            for the child to devise a consistent model of its world and next to 
            impossible to extrapolate the real world from the sparse queues that 
            happen to parallel the larger world out there. Yet if it should make 
            such an attempt it would almost inevitably use a 'bottom up' approach 
            trying to extend that which it knows from its simulated reality to 
            built connections to our real world. For instance, in order to come 
            up with a more comprehensive explanation for the correlation between 
            clicking the mouse and initiation of some action on the screen it 
            might theorise that the sound from clicking the mouse is the medium 
            for launching a next step in the game. If it were to try figure out 
            the three dimensional rendering on the flat screen of the monitor 
            it would be at an even greater loss and every movement that derives 
            from the three-dimensions of the real world would need a two-dimensional 
            explanation. In addition, two-dimensional objects on the screen possess 
            'magical' properties that lets your screen presence disappear, where 
            in the real world you merely move through an opening or behind the 
            object. Its theory of moving objects probably would ultimately develop 
            such that it could explain why, while they are 'obviously' flat, movement 
            seems to bring out a certain foreshortening of the most forward surfaces 
            in the direction of motion (as the object moves across the screen 
            these surfaces disappear altogether when they arrive at the middle 
            of the screen and even though the object continues to move the surfaces 
            remains hidden)- reaching this understanding would somewhat parallel 
            that of Albert Einstein in his theory of Relativity.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Not 
            surprisingly the child's attempts to connect its understanding of 
            motion through the scenes on the screen with that of the disappearance 
            phenomenon would be doomed. What it would need to do is take a bold 
            step outside its two dimensional world where it will find another 
            dimension that will let the child go through an opening itself and 
            also let it see these surfaces without foreshortening if viewed in 
            the direction of motion. The child would discover that shrinkage of 
            these surfaces is but a visual effect of what we call 'perspective' 
            and to understand both it and the disappearance phenomenon, it had 
            needed to perceive that third dimension. All at once its various theories 
            of its two-dimensional world would become whole and consistent, … 
            except that … the child would also realise that what might have been 
            an all consuming quest, its theories while sort of interesting are 
            no longer all that important. Never mind that this new world will 
            for instance offer the possibility of abandoning the game and starting 
            a new one, possibly adopting another game character or playing a different 
            game all together. Unfortunately, all the skills it learned in its 
            two-dimensional world will have a wholly different, possibly only 
            marginal value in a three-dimensional reality. Ironically in the process 
            of growing up in its confinement the child had learned other things 
            that it had never given a second thought, yet now these seem as relevant 
            albeit as distant as its formal theories, … because before it … beyond 
            the computer beckons a new much larger world to discover.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">The 
            above parable illustrates why science had failed to identify the conjunction 
            between Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, oversights in each theory 
            reinforced each other: without acknowledgement of the dimensionality 
            of time ultimate subjectivity of reality appears inconceivable and 
            vice versa. Once these concepts are accepted the next step follows 
            as a matter of course: an elementary (quantum) object is its own reference 
            frame with innate spatial and time measurements that are separate 
            from (but not unrelated to) those of the observer and its context. 
            Yet ultimately time measurements always relate to the observer's 'universal 
            time' in its reference frame- i.e. a measure of an object's time is 
            not directly accessible to the observer. Accordingly, a spatial measurement 
            obtained from the object will originate in a separate frame from the 
            one in which time is measured. Conversely, a spatial measurement that 
            originates in the same reference frame as time does not concern a 
            spatial characteristic of the object but always pertains to its position 
            in the space of the observer. Hence, an 'interval' that is calculated 
            from these measurements has a physical meaning that can only be related 
            to the observer and not to the innate characteristics of the object. 
            Nevertheless, the separate origins of spatial and time measurements 
            will suffice to probe an object's characteristics. Aided by time's 
            dimensionality which permits an alternate way of interpreting Relativity's 
            equations, the Lorentz transformations will convert a measurement 
            obtained in one frame to the corresponding one in the other frame 
            so that an equivalent set of measurements in the object's frame may 
            be obtained. As a result, not only will an object's characteristics 
            be revealed, but they are also shown to share a larger common 'universal' 
            reference frame with the observer.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">For 
            most of the 20th century this mental block sent physicists into different 
            directions where ever more convoluted schemes were uncovered that 
            forced the adoption of obscure mathematical language to describe them. 
            The fact that the mathematical equations that define the octahedron 
            apply to both the space-time geometry of Relativity and the microscopic 
            world of quanta, resolves what had become the most vexing problem 
            in 20th century physics: the unification of all fundamental forces 
            observed in nature. Most importantly, the properties of the vectors 
            that make up the octahedron and their relationships explain two 'hold-outs': 
            electromagnetic radiation and gravity, and shows that they rest on 
            the same fundamental principles. In fact gravity and our infinite 
            shuttle orbits derive from the same geometrical property, while electromagnetic 
            radiation propagates throughout space in the form of so-called sine 
            waves (their spectrum includes light) whose magnitude varies in the 
            same way as our space shuttle when it was bobbing back-and-forth (like 
            a clock's pendulum). Interestingly the observer cannot perceive the 
            octahedron in its entirety: it may observe its wave model or otherwise 
            encounter a discontinuity that provides the basis for the quantum 
            nature of the reality we experience.</font></p>
