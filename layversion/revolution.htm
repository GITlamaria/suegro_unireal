<META NAME="Description" CONTENT="This presentation confirms that the current understanding of space-time geometry is deficient and explains where and why. An integral account of the space-time continuum and its transformation to the quantum world is provided. In the course of its explanation the manner in which the fundamental forces of nature may be united is identified. Also shown is the origin of the breakup of the continuum into discrete quanta and of their interaction with the observer as cause for uncertainty in quantum trials. The unification of electromagnetism and gravity in a vector space that is fully consistent with the principles of Relativity will warrant the title of this presentation: Universal Reality.">

          <p class=MsoNormal align="center"><span lang=EN-US><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b>Revolution

          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Let 
            us examine two more examples, the first introducing the second, to 
            further illustrate how space disguises itself as time. Imagine yourself 
            astride a wooden horse on a carrousel: a merry-go-round at a fair 
            or midway. The carrousel starts to turn; soon it gyrates like an enormous 
            spinning top, still the other horses, their riders and the attendant 
            who walks amongst you remain part of its same merry surroundings that 
            you entered when the attraction was halted between rides. However, 
            during the ride bystanders and the rest of the fair soon whiz by in 
            a blur. Now if the carrousel should be open at the top, on a starry 
            night you might see some star straight above all but unaffected by 
            your rotation. In contrast other stars are moving in a circle at an 
            apparent increased speed the further off-centre they are, with the 
            ones just over the horizon almost as much a blur as the onlookers 
            near the carrousel. Now recall how spinning tops stay upright even 
            after hitting other objects (for instance other spinning tops) until 
            they have all but stopped turning? What keeps them from falling over 
            is due to the so-called gyroscopic action of the spin. Similarly, 
            all revolving masses such as our carrousel will resist a change of 
            the direction of their axis of rotation. Accordingly, it would take 
            force to tilt a turning carrousel; yet any displacement up and down 
            in the direction of the spin axis would not be resisted at all (all 
            it would take is lifting or lowering its weight). Now the interesting 
            thing about spin is that while its axis resists directional change 
            by an external force, it nevertheless can, all by it self, make a 
            kind spiralling motion, the same way spinning tops wobble. Suppose 
            its operator loses control and the runaway speed of the carrousel 
            subsequently causes its bearings to fail catastrophically. Say the 
            carrousel breaks free such that it flies off with its axis twirling 
            like a baton (but horizontally more like a spinning top that was knocked 
            over). Overcoming this frightful experience but still clinging to 
            your horse, you would find yourself cut-off from your familiar world 
            on the outside, now but a confusing blur, at best you might make out 
            the fair's lights flickering on-off as if alternating between daylight 
            and the darkness of night. Thus your small rotating island has become 
            a new reality in which you can orientate yourself while the space 
            of the fair on the outside makes no longer any sense. Likewise, to 
            the onlookers the twirling carrousel no longer has the shape of a 
            revolving disk but has become a blurred sphere, a featureless ball.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">As 
            the carrousel's speed increased you would have felt a growing force 
            pull you away from the carrousel's centre toward its edge. However, 
            once the carrousel and you are twirling through the air your horse 
            rips off its anchors and ends up wedged sideways between two poles 
            that were mounted along the edge to hold up the carrousel's canopy. 
            To your surprise you can get off the horse and walk around its base 
            as if it magically possessed gravity. In fact if the onlookers outside 
            would have trained their movie camera on this whole mishap and later 
            play the event back in slow-motion they would see that you had walked 
            everywhere on the inside of the blurred sphere they had seen, with 
            your head toward its centre. They would also have seen that a drink 
            that you spilled had formed a thin film of liquid all over the inside 
            of that illusory sphere. After watching the same amateur movie (following 
            recovery from your ordeal), you might come to the realisation that 
            given enough rotational speed, your body- if it hadn't been for the 
            skin and bones that keep us together- and similarly the horse, in 
            fact the carrousel and all composite matter in it, would like your 
            drink have been drawn in all directions crushed against the inside 
            of the apparent sphere. However, these tugs on the body and other 
            composite matter are opposed by the binding force of its constituents, 
            thus you experienced only a resultant force that kept your feet firmly 
            planted on the inside of that phantom sphere.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">While 
            now you may have some notion how space can be made to appear different 
            in all three directions, we have not yet made it sufficiently different, 
            in spite of several farfetched concessions to physical impositions 
            and limitations, to make it appear as time. To get yet closer to our 
            aim we will next take a ride on a much-improved merry-go-round: the 
            space shuttle.</font></p>
