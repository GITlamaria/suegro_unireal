<META NAME="Description" CONTENT="This presentation confirms that the current understanding of space-time geometry is deficient and explains where and why. An integral account of the space-time continuum and its transformation to the quantum world is provided. In the course of its explanation the manner in which the fundamental forces of nature may be united is identified. Also shown is the origin of the breakup of the continuum into discrete quanta and of their interaction with the observer as cause for uncertainty in quantum trials. The unification of electromagnetism and gravity in a vector space that is fully consistent with the principles of Relativity will warrant the title of this presentation: Universal Reality.">

            you ever woken up before your body has abandoned sleep? You lie in 
            a half-paralysed state yet the mind is crystal clear. Every day worries 
            will not disturb your inner peace, as solutions effortlessly appear 
            to dissolve previously insoluble problems. Your mind's eye, as if 
            no longer confined to your body, is but a point in its own space languishing 
            in a time stood still yet ballooned beyond the present. Then the first 
            stirring of morning brings back another reality, the bustle of daily 
            life with which you feel strangely at odds. In that transition you 
            know that while you are whole, the world beyond is but a smoke screen 
            covering disjointed beliefs and institutions. Soon a compulsion to 
            take up your regular routine and responsibilities takes over. Yet 
            a residual feeling remains that the world is not in harmony with … 
            they way things should be, if only you could figure out how: science 
            and religion are in disagreement over the most fundamental issues 
            of life, more often than not politics and the economy pursue cross 
            purposes, and society's bigotry strains your personal relationships. 
            Is such discord not a sign that all these separate realities are incomplete, 
            possibly flawed and but part of a greater reality? And that our further 
            progress may very well depend on our resolve to restore this dissonance 
            to harmony.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font size="-1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wide 
            ranging imaginative thoughts and inexplicable experiences have long 
            raised suspicion that indeed there is more to this world of ours than 
            meets the eye. However, speculation, faith and non-repeatable phenomena 
            provide no proof or explanation of a metaphysical world. Yet if a 
            transcending reality does exist then it will also offer a way to substantiate 
            it and, provided our science is not too far off the mark, it will 
            be possible with but minor revisions to describe it scientifically. 
            The presentation at this web site introduces just such a scientific 
            account of unifying some of these separate realities into a universal 
            greater reality. Its texts substantiate that indeed there are other 
            dimensions than the usual ones in which we spend our lives and its 
            main section provides the mathematical relations between our familiar 
            world and these newly recognised dimensions.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font size="-1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our 
            awareness does not reach beyond the three spatial dimensions we normally 
            experience, because any extra-dimensional perception does not appear 
            to extend survival in our usual environment. Hence, we lack the innate 
            ability for regular perception of such other unseen dimensions that, 
            nevertheless, as related elsewhere at this site are still just space 
            and time. The questions that this revelation raises are many, such 
            as whether these other dimensions will make it possible to cross the 
            vast distances of space within a fraction of a lifetime (defying the 
            speed of light) if not travel through time (of course we already travel 
            through time, however, when we think of time travel we mean a controlled 
            leap to the past or future). Even more profound, will we have an existence 
            in these other dimensions separate from the one in this physical world 
            and so survive the death of our body? In fact this web site introduces 
            such a reality in which we are both <a href="popobs.htm">observers</a> 
            and actors whose role while coincident during our presence in this 
            world is otherwise detached from its mundane concerns and physical 
            manifestation. Accordingly, the answer to the above and many related 
            questions is that all these expectations may come true, except that 
            they will be realised in this larger universal reality that cannot 
            be readily understood in terms of the very limited sense of our present 
            fractured realities.</font></p>

            Triumph of Time...</b></font></span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Space 
            and time are the two most basic measures by which we define our situation 
            with respect to our surroundings. We go about our daily lives aware 
            that we can move about in an east-west and a north-south direction 
            as well to some extent up and down: in other words in three spatial 
            directions. However, this spatial environment evolves continually, 
            in some ways so subtly that we are not really aware of its alteration 
            such as that caused by the slow erosion of a mountaintop. Other changes, 
            while not always apparent on a daily basis, can only be appreciated 
            over the course of several seasons, for instance the planting of seedlings 
            and the subsequent crop harvest. Nevertheless, most often we are reminded 
            of the relentless imposition of changes on our surroundings by mankind 
            and by the interactions and changes that we personally initiate: the 
            progress of time. So the passing of time means changes to our spatial 
            environment. Evidently space and time have an intimate relationship 
            with each other even if in our every day life we tend to forget that 
            there is such a connection. Yet hard evidence of its precise nature 
            had eluded science until Albert Einstein devised his theory of relativistic 
            time and space. 'Relativity' showed that space and time somehow become 
            ever more alike, as if they were two different sides of the same coin, 
            the higher the velocities involved and identical when the speed of 
            light is reached, although the theory could not fully explain the 
            nature of this identity. Although this dual nature of 'space-time' 
            is not apparent at the low velocities that we experience in everyday 
            life, experiments with high velocity sub-atomic particles have upheld 
            the theory of Special Relativity. A small aberration in the orbit 
            of the planet Mercury provided an indirect confirmation that General 
            Relativity was also correct <a href="http://www.humboldt1.com/%7Egralsto/einstein/relativ.html.">http://www.humboldt1.com/~gralsto/einstein/relativ.html.</a></font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Not 
            surprisingly the relationship between space and time was found to 
            be unlike that between two dimensions of space. For instance, in our 
            every day world spatial relationships frequently concern distance 
            and direction to some destination, often with a choice of different 
            routes. If our destination were in say in a north-westerly direction, 
            we could choose a route that goes in that general direction and even 
            if it heads a bit too far south we would drive the last part of the 
            trip due north until we had reached our goal. On the other hand had 
            we initially taken an even more southerly route, then the last stretch 
            north toward our destination would simply be longer. However, the 
            direct distance 'as the crow flies' remains unaffected regardless 
            which route we would have chosen: distance is invariable regardless 
            the length of the route we take. In a sense the direct distance resembles 
            what Relativity calls 'interval' except that the latter is calculated 
            from time and space measurements as opposed to the former which may 
            be calculated from the westerly and northerly route segments. </font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">According 
            to Relativity when we measure the time lapse and distance between 
            two events- for instance the appearance and end of a 'falling star' 
            that has entered the earth's atmosphere- we obtain different results 
            on earth compared to those reported by an astronaut aboard a spaceship 
            moving at a great speed with respect to us. It is as if the measurements 
            taken by the astronaut concerned a different route through space-time 
            from the one we experienced, yet each set of measurements will let 
            us calculate the same result for the interval that characterises the 
            falling star.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Specifically, 
            when space and time are accurately measured in a moving environment 
            the results will differ as if it had taken more time for a shorter 
            distance compared to corresponding measurements obtained while stationary. 
            In fact when the event involves velocities that approach or equal 
            the speed of light, this kind of foreshortening effect and slowing 
            down of time will be so pronounced that the spatial part will all 
            but vanish while the advance of time will seem to have come to a standstill. 
            It is the latter effect that is the source of many apparent paradoxes 
            of which possibly the best known has space travellers visit another 
            world, a voyage of a few years away, but upon their return find that 
            meanwhile on earth everyone has aged decades. We will return to Relativity's 
            mysterious interval, however, let us first visit some other worlds 
            of our own to probe the intimate relationship between space and time. 
            Instead of a rocket we will employ some more of our mind's imaginative 
            powers for lift off. </font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="center"><span lang=EN-US><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b>...And 
            Truth</b></font></span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">In 
            spite of its success at the scale of cosmic phenomena, no one was 
            able to figure out how Relativity could be applied to the very small 
            scale of the elementary particles that appear to make up the matter 
            of our bodies and the objects we see around us. The presentation in 
            this web site confirms that indeed time is just a different way of 
            looking at space and explains how by adopting the proper viewpoint 
            we can observe elementary particles in such a way that they will be 
            consistent with the space and time of Relativity. You might wonder 
            how this might be accomplished, have we not explored all possible 
            spatial points of view? The answer may be surprising at first but 
            upon reflection will have a lot more common sense then the conventional 
            and Relativistic notion of time: if time only seems different from 
            space because we the observer have assumed an orientation that will 
            not let us see it as space, then time like space must also have three 
            dimensions.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">How 
            can we acquire a sense of how it is possible that space can give us 
            an experience of time that is totally different from that of the usual 
            view of our spatial surroundings? Actually a simple demonstration 
            will provide such a foretaste: take any object, say a pen, hold it 
            with its length in the line-of-sight and look at it with only one 
            eye. Notice that the length of the pen is actually invisible to the 
            eye: we only see its tip or whatever faces us and we are unable to 
            see its third <a href="popdimension.htm">dimension</a> - the only 
            reason we can see its length is because we normally have both eyes 
            open so that at least one eye will see another side of the object. 
            This simple example shows that space in a direction away from us (in 
            the line-of-sight) is somehow experienced differently from that facing 
            us. In fact, the closest analogy to the passage of time is the way 
            anything in the line-of-sight intersects our vision. For instance, 
            a stack of photographs with subtle changes in successive scenes will 
            give us the illusion of motion (a phenomenon that motion pictures 
            cleverly exploit), whose speed, i.e. progress in time, we can control 
            by the rate at which each photographic frame is brought into view.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="center"><span lang=EN-US><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b>Revolution 
            </b></font></span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Let 
            us examine two more examples, the first introducing the second, to 
            further illustrate how space disguises itself as time. Imagine yourself 
            astride a wooden horse on a carrousel: a merry-go-round at a fair 
            or midway. The carrousel starts to turn; soon it gyrates like an enormous 
            spinning top, still the other horses, their riders and the attendant 
            who walks amongst you remain part of its same merry surroundings that 
            you entered when the attraction was halted between rides. However, 
            during the ride bystanders and the rest of the fair soon whiz by in 
            a blur. Now if the carrousel should be open at the top, on a starry 
            night you might see some star straight above all but unaffected by 
            your rotation. In contrast other stars are moving in a circle at an 
            apparent increased speed the further off-centre they are, with the 
            ones just over the horizon almost as much a blur as the onlookers 
            near the carrousel. Now recall how spinning tops stay upright even 
            after hitting other objects (for instance other spinning tops) until 
            they have all but stopped turning? What keeps them from falling over 
            is due to the so-called gyroscopic action of the spin. Similarly, 
            all revolving masses such as our carrousel will resist a change of 
            the direction of their axis of rotation. Accordingly, it would take 
            force to tilt a turning carrousel; yet any displacement up and down 
            in the direction of the spin axis would not be resisted at all (all 
            it would take is lifting or lowering its weight). Now the interesting 
            thing about spin is that while its axis resists directional change 
            by an external force, it nevertheless can, all by it self, make a 
            kind spiralling motion, the same way spinning tops wobble. Suppose 
            its operator loses control and the runaway speed of the carrousel 
            subsequently causes its bearings to fail catastrophically. Say the 
            carrousel breaks free such that it flies off with its axis twirling 
            like a baton (but horizontally more like a spinning top that was knocked 
            over). Overcoming this frightful experience but still clinging to 
            your horse, you would find yourself cut-off from your familiar world 
            on the outside, now but a confusing blur, at best you might make out 
            the fair's lights flickering on-off as if alternating between daylight 
            and the darkness of night. Thus your small rotating island has become 
            a new reality in which you can orientate yourself while the space 
            of the fair on the outside makes no longer any sense. Likewise, to 
            the onlookers the twirling carrousel no longer has the shape of a 
            revolving disk but has become a blurred sphere, a featureless ball.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">As 
            the carrousel's speed increased you would have felt a growing force 
            pull you away from the carrousel's centre toward its edge. However, 
            once the carrousel and you are twirling through the air your horse 
            rips off its anchors and ends up wedged sideways between two poles 
            that were mounted along the edge to hold up the carrousel's canopy. 
            To your surprise you can get off the horse and walk around its base 
            as if it magically possessed gravity. In fact if the onlookers outside 
            would have trained their movie camera on this whole mishap and later 
            play the event back in slow-motion they would see that you had walked 
            everywhere on the inside of the blurred sphere they had seen, with 
            your head toward its centre. They would also have seen that a drink 
            that you spilled had formed a thin film of liquid all over the inside 
            of that illusory sphere. After watching the same amateur movie (following 
            recovery from your ordeal), you might come to the realisation that 
            given enough rotational speed, your body- if it hadn't been for the 
            skin and bones that keep us together- and similarly the horse, in 
            fact the carrousel and all composite matter in it, would like your 
            drink have been drawn in all directions crushed against the inside 
            of the apparent sphere. However, these tugs on the body and other 
            composite matter are opposed by the binding force of its constituents, 
            thus you experienced only a resultant force that kept your feet firmly 
            planted on the inside of that phantom sphere.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">While 
            now you may have some notion how space can be made to appear different 
            in all three directions, we have not yet made it sufficiently different, 
            in spite of several farfetched concessions to physical impositions 
            and limitations, to make it appear as time. To get yet closer to our 
            aim we will next take a ride on a much-improved merry-go-round: the 
            space shuttle.</font></p>

          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Inside 
            the space shuttle once it has attained orbit, the grasp of earth's 
            gravity largely cancels the very forces that tugged at you and kept 
            you pinned to the inside of the illusive sphere of the twirling carrousel. 
            More so these forces are perfectly cancelled for the centre of our 
            own minuscule gravity- let's call it our mind's eye and rely on our 
            skin and bones to keep the rest of us together. This mind's eye like 
            the intersection of cross-hairs in our camera's viewfinder has no 
            volume: it is an infinitely small point in space. A point that just 
            floats in space without direction or acceleration, unaware of the 
            speed that observers on the earth's surface confer on it. Of course 
            ground control would say that the shuttle and our mind's eye in it 
            are in a circular orbit around the earth. Yet neither speed nor the 
            curved path through space are directly measurable by us and we could 
            just as well dismiss the controllers' insistence that we are moving 
            on the basis of the observable fact that they are the ones who are 
            rotating on a sphere at some distance from us- in fact aren't they, 
            not us, the ones who are accelerated (by gravity). To further our 
            argument we could point out that the same would still be true had 
            mission control sent us in what it would have called the opposite 
            direction- in fact we could be going in any direction and with an 
            increased or decreased ground speed at any lower or higher altitude 
            and it still be all the same to us. And why not make the orbit that 
            the controllers on earth tell us about oval - if only earth would 
            not be in the way we could make the orbit increasingly more elliptical 
            and still not experience any movement. In fact if we would make the 
            furthest point of our ellipse so far that the earth appears as if 
            almost an infinitely small dot in space, we would find ourselves bobbing 
            back-and-forth along (almost) the same line or along however many 
            such lines of a different direction that we would care to choose.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Now 
            the point of all this is to demonstrate that our orbits could cover 
            all of space and yet it would be all the same point to our mind's 
            eye. The reason is that our mind's eye experiences no acceleration 
            that would indicate it is starting to move somewhere: it considers 
            itself at rest- it does not make any progress in its space no matter 
            how long- indefinitely and, long after our skin and bones have ceased 
            to exist, to eternity. Thus we could imagine any set of intersecting 
            orbits that are populated by a section of our mind's eye, yet since 
            none of these ever moves anywhere they would admit that at times in 
            their eternal persistence they experience a coincidence: a coincidence 
            not in space but in time only. In other words all space occupies just 
            one infinitely small point for all time: our mind's eye has achieved 
            a position from which the entire universe is observed as- wait …- 
            since there is no other space- as time, going in all directions: time 
            has the same three dimensions as space, and it not only appears likewise 
            but is no different from space for only the viewpoint of our observation 
            has changed. Of course, while time may look just like space, the things 
            in it such as the moon and stars would come to resemble the occasional 
            blurs that we remember from the disastrous carrousel ride. Incredibly 
            we have changed our viewpoint from the closed sphere of all possible 
            shuttle orbits that the ground controllers might observe, to one in 
            which we are the centre of the most complex motions that everything 
            else seems to undergo. A feat as if we had managed to turn an onion 
            the size of the universe inside-out. An inverted onion whose former 
            centre has become the outermost layer, while its skin is now nothing 
            more than part of that infinitesimal point that we let our mind's 
            eye occupy, all of space in our everyday universe compressed into 
            a single point for all time.</font></p>

            now we recognise a situation in which in a blink of an eye- that transition 
            between two moments in time- we can not only see all of space but 
            another situation just like it, in which our mind's eye never closes 
            to see all of time, while its space is no more than a point- a single 
            intersection with our usual space. However, we also recognise that 
            neither represents the world in which we live, for that world somehow 
            has a bit of both. We see two space dimensions directly and our eyes 
            and brain together figure out a third: depth in the line-of-sight. 
            Thus on the one hand, part of us acknowledges the three dimensions 
            of space at any moment in time, while on the other hand we only sense 
            two space dimension directly with the third inferred in the line-of-sight, 
            giving us the experience of another dimension: not all but one arrow

            act of observing an event involves space-time measurements in a known 
            setting- a frame of reference. Each measurement provides direction 
            and a measure for how far any event (i.e. a point on an Einstein interval 
            <a href="popups/hyperbola.htm" target="popup">hyperbola</a>) is from 
            some agreed reference direction and common point of origin. In mathematics 
            the combination of direction and magnitude (a measure of some quantity 
            like length) are represented by what is called a vector, in effect 
            an arrow of a certain length and direction. Like direction signs on 
            a traffic pole, vectors can have a point in common and provided they 
            point in different directions in effect define the angle between the 
            surfaces on which they lie. Hence, a vector can also be the line in 
            which two surfaces intersect each other (i.e. like the traffic pole 
            to which the direction signs are connected and where they in effect 
            meet). It turns out that there is a way of connecting the vectors 
            representing the measurements of space and time mentioned earlier, 
            including the latter's newly identified dimensions, in a diagram. 
            The symmetrical geometric figure that results has eight surfaces- 
            a so-called octahedron, and is shown in the home page of this web 
            site. What makes the octahedron so interesting is that it derives 
            directly from the mathematical equations of Relativity (those defining 
            the Einstein interval and its so-called Lorentz transformations). 
            Its derivation and the fact that it can be constructed at all are 
            the result of explanations, presented at this web site, why attempts 
            to apply Relativity to the elementary objects that make up the material 
            world around us failed. A simple oversight became a formidable barrier 
            to finding the philosophical basis for measuring the space and time 
            components of elementary particles (called quanta) in such a way that 
            they be consistent with Relativity. </font></p>

            cause for the mental block that has stymied efforts to advance Physics 
            has no easy parallel in our macroscopic world. Nevertheless, some 
            'alternate reality' video games may provide some sense of the trap 
            that science fell into. These games provide a visually simulated fantasy 
            world with which the player interacts through the monitor and manual 
            controls, e.g. the point-and-click of a computer mouse. However, no 
            other physical stimulation or queues such as movement, temperature 
            etc. are provided to enforce the player's sense of immersion into 
            the alternate reality of the game. With the benefit of the player's 
            knowledge of the real world on which the fantasy world is loosely 
            modelled, the mind's imagination compensates for the missing sensations. 
            Imagine what would happen if one were brought into the world the child 
            of deranged psychiatrists (no insinuation to demerit the field of 
            psychiatry is intended- it just happens to serve the present example). 
            Suppose these delusional parents had decided by way of experiment 
            to raise their child entirely in the fantasy world of such a video 
            game, with as only concession to the real world the provision of nutrients, 
            for excretion and mechanical stimulation for the child's physical 
            development. Lacking any other clues, the child would come to accept 
            the simulated world as its own and rationalise everything in it to 
            be consistent with the limits of its confines. The correlation of 
            hand movements of the mouse with motion on the screen would likely 
            present a conceptual problem not unlike that posed by the Relativity 
            and Quantum theories: the connection between the two would be inaccessible. 
            Obviously, neither the action on the screen nor of the computer mouse 
            can be associated with activities and their effect that the child 
            does not know such as real motion and acceleration when walking or 
            jumping.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">It 
            may be appreciated that under these circumstances it would be difficult 
            for the child to devise a consistent model of its world and next to 
            impossible to extrapolate the real world from the sparse queues that 
            happen to parallel the larger world out there. Yet if it should make 
            such an attempt it would almost inevitably use a 'bottom up' approach 
            trying to extend that which it knows from its simulated reality to 
            built connections to our real world. For instance, in order to come 
            up with a more comprehensive explanation for the correlation between 
            clicking the mouse and initiation of some action on the screen it 
            might theorise that the sound from clicking the mouse is the medium 
            for launching a next step in the game. If it were to try figure out 
            the three dimensional rendering on the flat screen of the monitor 
            it would be at an even greater loss and every movement that derives 
            from the three-dimensions of the real world would need a two-dimensional 
            explanation. In addition, two-dimensional objects on the screen possess 
            'magical' properties that lets your screen presence disappear, where 
            in the real world you merely move through an opening or behind the 
            object. Its theory of moving objects probably would ultimately develop 
            such that it could explain why, while they are 'obviously' flat, movement 
            seems to bring out a certain foreshortening of the most forward surfaces 
            in the direction of motion (as the object moves across the screen 
            these surfaces disappear altogether when they arrive at the middle 
            of the screen and even though the object continues to move the surfaces 
            remains hidden)- reaching this understanding would somewhat parallel 
            that of Albert Einstein in his theory of Relativity.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Not 
            surprisingly the child's attempts to connect its understanding of 
            motion through the scenes on the screen with that of the disappearance 
            phenomenon would be doomed. What it would need to do is take a bold 
            step outside its two dimensional world where it will find another 
            dimension that will let the child go through an opening itself and 
            also let it see these surfaces without foreshortening if viewed in 
            the direction of motion. The child would discover that shrinkage of 
            these surfaces is but a visual effect of what we call 'perspective' 
            and to understand both it and the disappearance phenomenon, it had 
            needed to perceive that third dimension. All at once its various theories 
            of its two-dimensional world would become whole and consistent, … 
            except that … the child would also realise that what might have been 
            an all consuming quest, its theories while sort of interesting are 
            no longer all that important. Never mind that this new world will 
            for instance offer the possibility of abandoning the game and starting 
            a new one, possibly adopting another game character or playing a different 
            game all together. Unfortunately, all the skills it learned in its 
            two-dimensional world will have a wholly different, possibly only 
            marginal value in a three-dimensional reality. Ironically in the process 
            of growing up in its confinement the child had learned other things 
            that it had never given a second thought, yet now these seem as relevant 
            albeit as distant as its formal theories, … because before it … beyond 
            the computer beckons a new much larger world to discover.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">The 
            above parable illustrates why science had failed to identify the conjunction 
            between Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, oversights in each theory 
            reinforced each other: without acknowledgement of the dimensionality 
            of time ultimate subjectivity of reality appears inconceivable and 
            vice versa. Once these concepts are accepted the next step follows 
            as a matter of course: an elementary (quantum) object is its own reference 
            frame with innate spatial and time measurements that are separate 
            from (but not unrelated to) those of the observer and its context. 
            Yet ultimately time measurements always relate to the observer's 'universal 
            time' in its reference frame- i.e. a measure of an object's time is 
            not directly accessible to the observer. Accordingly, a spatial measurement 
            obtained from the object will originate in a separate frame from the 
            one in which time is measured. Conversely, a spatial measurement that 
            originates in the same reference frame as time does not concern a 
            spatial characteristic of the object but always pertains to its position 
            in the space of the observer. Hence, an 'interval' that is calculated 
            from these measurements has a physical meaning that can only be related 
            to the observer and not to the innate characteristics of the object. 
            Nevertheless, the separate origins of spatial and time measurements 
            will suffice to probe an object's characteristics. Aided by time's 
            dimensionality which permits an alternate way of interpreting Relativity's 
            equations, the Lorentz transformations will convert a measurement 
            obtained in one frame to the corresponding one in the other frame 
            so that an equivalent set of measurements in the object's frame may 
            be obtained. As a result, not only will an object's characteristics 
            be revealed, but they are also shown to share a larger common 'universal' 
            reference frame with the observer.</font></p>

            most of the 20th century this mental block sent physicists into different 
            directions where ever more convoluted schemes were uncovered that 
            forced the adoption of obscure mathematical language to describe them. 
            The fact that the mathematical equations that define the octahedron 
            apply to both the space-time geometry of Relativity and the microscopic 
            world of quanta, resolves what had become the most vexing problem 
            in 20th century physics: the unification of all fundamental forces 
            observed in nature. Most importantly, the properties of the vectors 
            that make up the octahedron and their relationships explain two 'hold-outs': 
            electromagnetic radiation and gravity, and shows that they rest on 
            the same fundamental principles. In fact gravity and our infinite 
            shuttle orbits derive from the same geometrical property, while electromagnetic 
            radiation propagates throughout space in the form of so-called sine 
            waves (their spectrum includes light) whose magnitude varies in the 
            same way as our space shuttle when it was bobbing back-and-forth (like 
            a clock's pendulum). Interestingly the observer cannot perceive the 
            octahedron in its entirety: it may observe its wave model or otherwise 
            encounter a discontinuity that provides the basis for the quantum 
            nature of the reality we experience.</font></p>

            by relatively minor but essential extensions to mathematics and physics. 
            Yet these new concepts did not solely come about as a consequence 
            of philosophical deliberation and thought experiments. Unification 
            resulted as a natural byproduct of identifying and deconstructing 
            prevailing misconceptions using kind of a finished model as a guide 
            - not unlike cutting puzzle pieces from the picture on the box cover 
            such that they match the partially assembled fragments of the puzzle 
            on the table. This 'finished model' had 'come into my hands' as a 
            result of an experience that I had in the spring of 1979. At the time 
            I was asked if I would explain some aspect of electromagnetism- I 
            do not recall the actual question. Not long into my reply it occurred 
            to me that its conventional approach seemed more difficult to understand 
            than warranted and likely would lead to only more questions. I had 
            an intuition that a thought experiment involving 'a ride aboard an 
            electrical field' would lead to a clearer more expedient Relativistic 
            explanation. The informality of the situation had suppressed the fact 
            that Relativity offered no such explanation and soon I found myself 
            resorting to a line of reasoning that took me beyond the accepted 
            context of Relativity. It was this point of departure that as if triggered 
            a vision of how physical reality fit together and- in retrospect not 
            surprising as my expanded perception concerned what some had dubbed 
            the 'theory of everything'- engulfed me in an avalanche of its ramifications.</font></p>

            experience was instantaneous without forewarning and monumental, yet 
            I managed to finish my explanation without indication of what had 
            happened and without attracting queries over my unorthodox treatment 
            of the subject. However, it conferred on me what metaphorically I 
            have likened to a 'picture on the cover of a puzzle box'. I realised 
            that while complete, the picture as the case of a puzzle box cover 
            did not identify the shape of the pieces or the ones missing from 
            the puzzle of reality and its many parts that had already been assembled. 
            More specifically, its depiction of reality did not aim to provide 
            proof but to provide guidance to the task of completing the puzzle. 
            Since such undertaking would be a lengthy affair, I could not let 
            time dull the experience and therefore set out to capture it in words. 
            Having freed myself from the concentration that scientific proofs 
            demand, an impressionistic rendition held the promise of preserving

            are parts and animated examples in the main text that will be accessible 
            to many; also the links to other subtexts may now be easier to understand, 
            including surprisingly the two on mathematics. Fare ye well.</font></p>
