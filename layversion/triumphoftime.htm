<META NAME="Description" CONTENT="This presentation confirms that the current understanding of space-time geometry is deficient and explains where and why. An integral account of the space-time continuum and its transformation to the quantum world is provided. In the course of its explanation the manner in which the fundamental forces of nature may be united is identified. Also shown is the origin of the breakup of the continuum into discrete quanta and of their interaction with the observer as cause for uncertainty in quantum trials. The unification of electromagnetism and gravity in a vector space that is fully consistent with the principles of Relativity will warrant the title of this presentation: Universal Reality.">

          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Space 
            and time are the two most basic measures by which we define our situation 
            with respect to our surroundings. We go about our daily lives aware 
            that we can move about in an east-west and a north-south direction 
            as well to some extent up and down: in other words in three spatial 
            directions. However, this spatial environment evolves continually, 
            in some ways so subtly that we are not really aware of its alteration 
            such as that caused by the slow erosion of a mountaintop. Other changes, 
            while not always apparent on a daily basis, can only be appreciated 
            over the course of several seasons, for instance the planting of seedlings 
            and the subsequent crop harvest. Nevertheless, most often we are reminded 
            of the relentless imposition of changes on our surroundings by mankind 
            and by the interactions and changes that we personally initiate: the 
            progress of time. So the passing of time means changes to our spatial 
            environment. Evidently space and time have an intimate relationship 
            with each other even if in our every day life we tend to forget that 
            there is such a connection. Yet hard evidence of its precise nature 
            had eluded science until Albert Einstein devised his theory of relativistic 
            time and space. 'Relativity' showed that space and time somehow become 
            ever more alike, as if they were two different sides of the same coin, 
            the higher the velocities involved and identical when the speed of 
            light is reached, although the theory could not fully explain the 
            nature of this identity. Although this dual nature of 'space-time' 
            is not apparent at the low velocities that we experience in everyday 
            life, experiments with high velocity sub-atomic particles have upheld 
            the theory of Special Relativity. A small aberration in the orbit 
            of the planet Mercury provided an indirect confirmation that General 
            Relativity was also correct.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Not 
            surprisingly the relationship between space and time was found to 
            be unlike that between two dimensions of space. For instance, in our 
            every day world spatial relationships frequently concern distance 
            and direction to some destination, often with a choice of different 
            routes. If our destination were in say in a north-westerly direction, 
            we could choose a route that goes in that general direction and even 
            if it heads a bit too far south we would drive the last part of the 
            trip due north until we had reached our goal. On the other hand had 
            we initially taken an even more southerly route, then the last stretch 
            north toward our destination would simply be longer. However, the 
            direct distance 'as the crow flies' remains unaffected regardless 
            which route we would have chosen: distance is invariable regardless 
            the length of the route we take. In a sense the direct distance resembles 
            what Relativity calls 'interval' except that the latter is calculated 
            from time and space measurements as opposed to the former which may 
            be calculated from the westerly and northerly route segments. </font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">According 
            to Relativity when we measure the time lapse and distance between 
            two events- for instance the appearance and end of a 'falling star' 
            that has entered the earth's atmosphere- we obtain different results 
            on earth compared to those reported by an astronaut aboard a spaceship 
            moving at a great speed with respect to us. It is as if the measurements 
            taken by the astronaut concerned a different route through space-time 
            from the one we experienced, yet each set of measurements will let 
            us calculate the same result for the interval that characterises the 
            falling star.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Specifically, 
            when space and time are accurately measured in a moving environment 
            the results will differ as if it had taken more time for a shorter 
            distance compared to corresponding measurements obtained while stationary. 
            In fact when the event involves velocities that approach or equal 
            the speed of light, this kind of foreshortening effect and slowing 
            down of time will be so pronounced that the spatial part will all 
            but vanish while the advance of time will seem to have come to a standstill. 
            It is the latter effect that is the source of many apparent paradoxes 
            of which possibly the best known has space travellers visit another 
            world, a voyage of a few years away, but upon their return find that 
            meanwhile on earth everyone has aged decades. We will return to Relativity's 
            mysterious interval, however, let us first visit some other worlds 
            of our own to probe the intimate relationship between space and time. 
            Instead of a rocket we will employ some more of our mind's imaginative 
            powers for lift off.</font></p>
