<META NAME="Description" CONTENT="This presentation confirms that the current understanding of space-time geometry is deficient and explains where and why. An integral account of the space-time continuum and its transformation to the quantum world is provided. In the course of its explanation the manner in which the fundamental forces of nature may be united is identified. Also shown is the origin of the breakup of the continuum into discrete quanta and of their interaction with the observer as cause for uncertainty in quantum trials. The unification of electromagnetism and gravity in a vector space that is fully consistent with the principles of Relativity will warrant the title of this presentation: Universal Reality.">

                          a scalar) contributing members to a class representing<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
                          </span>‘to be’ and, representing ‘not to be’, an another 
                          class that does not share any members with the former.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The latter will not be some negative state 
                          of being which would have an effect in objective reality, 
                          but will be imaginary because ‘not to be’ means the 
                          true absence of ‘being’.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In other words, the extended logic system is 
                          synonymous with a universe of space-time whose continuum 
                          is defined by real and imaginary spatial and temporal 
                          dimensions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Hence, 
                          what we have called objective reality is actually subject 
                          to the constituent components of space-time that lie 
                          outside our physical reality; hence, the latter appears 
                          to be relative and subjective.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Accordingly, the temporal components can be said to determine the 
                          reality that we experience as much as being a consequence 
                          of our reality.<o:p></o:p></span></span></font><span

                          ambivalent nature of the extended logic also finds an 
                          echo in experiments involving quantum states of a system 
                          of correlated twin particles (photons).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In such experiments the results obtained by 
                          an observer of one particle are instantaneously affected 
                          depending on whether or not a second observer who is 
                          non-local to the first, has made an observation (measurement) 
                          of a quantum state of the particle's correlated twin.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(However, the instantaneous action will only 
                          become evident after correlating the two otherwise random 
                          results- i.e. after the fact: Bell's theorem shows that 
                          the uncertainty relation in quantum measurements is 
                          preserved even when the choice of measurement is made 
                          after separation of the two particles, and cannot be 
                          communicated in time to explain the preservation of 
                          the correlation, i.e. will not exceed the velocity of 
                          light).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These parallels may be less surprising if we 
                          remember that propositions consist of elements, class 
                          members and their predicates linked by relations that 
                          quantify their state as either true or false- the above
