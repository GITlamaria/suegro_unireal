        oversights in current interpretations of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics 
        that have rendered the two theories irreconcilable, included are a discourse 
        on the unification of these theories and of the four fundamental forces 
        of nature, an extension of mathematical principles and a geometric explanation 
        of the nature of time, light, matter and gravity with links to illustrations 
        and examples (familiarity with the theories of Relativity and Quantum 
        Mechanics and associated mathematics, while not necessarily a prerequisite,
