<META NAME="Description" CONTENT="This presentation confirms that the current understanding of space-time geometry is deficient and explains where and why. An integral account of the space-time continuum and its transformation to the quantum world is provided. In the course of its explanation the manner in which the fundamental forces of nature may be united is identified. Also shown is the origin of the breakup of the continuum into discrete quanta and of their interaction with the observer as cause for uncertainty in quantum trials. The unification of electromagnetism and gravity in a vector space that is fully consistent with the principles of Relativity will warrant the title of this presentation: Universal Reality.">

            is ambivalent in its treatment of space-time: the relation between 
            a spatial vector and time being less than a scalar- no sign, and less 
            than a vector- one direction (ostensibly orthonormal to real space), 
            disqualifies it as truly geometric. Invariance of the Einstein interval 
            is thus relegated to a mere algebraic relation, i.e. its individual 
            members of the same class are not equal, hence, the equation of intervals 
            is not a true identity: it cannot qualify for 'three bars'. A resolution 
            that is congruent with 2. above removes the inconsistency such that 
            the equation becomes a true identity.</font></div>

            the observer's unprimed frame, its spatial measurement (unlike its 
            macroscopic observations) obtains from the primed frame of the object. 
            Hence, the Einstein interval is not a relevant parameter of an elementary 
            object, but the vector sum of spatial and temporal measurements 'one 
            with and the other without a prime' is. The resolution in 3. above 
            also permits another observational perspective: that of an elementary 
            object in two Lorentz frames whose difference to the observer is (only) 
            the parallax angle between their respective spatial coordinates.</font></div>

            subjective) is deemed at least identical for all observers (the 'Copenhagen'

            of observer-event interaction: to an observer other observers are 
            simply synonymous with other events, consequently all observers are 
            mutually subjective. Hence, while an observer will receive a consistent 
            account of an event from each of the other observers, individual observers 
            will not necessarily witness the same reality of an event. Reality 
            ultimately and inexorably is fundamentally subjective in Lorentz space-time, 
            yet congruent and thus objective in the 'extended 3-space' in 6. above, 
            i.e. 6. explains 7. which in turn affirms 6. </font></div>

            Because of the nature of its subject the presentation is lengthy and 
            in a format that does not fit the usual for scientific papers. When 
            presenting the philosophical foundation for an expanded set of 'self-evident' 
            truths, formalism and discourse will fall inherently short of criteria 
            imposed by publications: philosophy is not the derivative of formalism 
            but is its basis that in our case extends beyond existing axioms. 
            Since 7. above imposes a firm and possibly unwelcome constraint on 
            'the scientific method', this account has instead been unveiled at 
            this web site. </font></p>
