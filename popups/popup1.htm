and definition the temperature in this reference frame will be zero Kelvin. Yet 
any coordinate point in this universal inertial reference frame would be in motion 
with respect to any other point observed in any Lorentz reference frame and the 
total aggregate of their loci should correspond to the observed average temperature 
just above zero Kelvin-an indication that a universal frame exists to which all 
sub-ordinal frames including Lorentz and Euclidean frames may be referenced. Of 
course 'temperature' is a measure of the aggregate of individual motions with 
respect to an observer and thus pertains only to the aggregate world that we see 
around us. Hence, temperature serves no direct role in understanding the nature 
of the underlying fundamental reality of elementary objects that populate our 
ostensibly Euclidean universe.</font>
