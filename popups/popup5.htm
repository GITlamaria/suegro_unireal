that follows we will generally refer to space-time variables in terms of vectors 
even when these are represented in equations by trigonometric relationships of 
scalars. The reason will become apparent, as we will introduce a transformation 
from hyperbolic to circular functions that might be less clear to the general 
readership if the equations would be in vector form only.</font>
