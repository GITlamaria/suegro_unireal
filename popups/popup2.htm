<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000"> Some might 
speculate if 'ether' has perhaps returned in a very turbulent form: the answer, 
of course, is negative; a continuum of all the space-time wrinkles in the universe 
will be introduced, but no medium. It is as if we would project a familiar object 
onto a crumpled box only to be confronted with startling evidence that the projection 
denotes its actual topology, while if we could conceive the box as our vantage 
point, the true shape of the object would look strangely distorted when compared 
to the apparent external view. Thus we are forced to concede that not the box 
but the initial observation was somehow crumpled- and so it is with our universal 
reference frame, only it and the distortion of our corporal vision 
is more profound</font>
