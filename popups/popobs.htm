<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000"> The observer 
in these texts is more than just a passive spectator of some event but even if 
unaware inevitably participates in its creation, drawn in as if the event's purpose 
includes providing context to the observer for an as yet subliminal goal. In other 
words the observer and the event are part of a larger plot- a kind of audience 
participation play in which the observer is also an actor. Although in every day 
life we tend to think of the act of witnessing anything in our surroundings as 
passive, yet there are many situations that place us in the dual role of spectator 
and participant. Whenever we go to the theatre we will affect the performance 
even if indirectly: our applause buoys the actors, lack of applause will have 
the opposite effect. More directly, if it were not for our patronage and that 
of the public there would be no performance after the first to enjoy. Accordingly, 
the act of observation extends well beyond the eyes or the brain that processes 
its images but influences the reality that we experience and thus renders it subjective.
