<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">A hyperbola 
  is a mathematical function that profiles the invariance of the Einstein interval. 
  A hyperbolic function looks like a cut straight down an ice cream cone that 
  was started anywhere off centre and thus ends short of the tip of the cone (the 
  cut-off section will be curved and look like a combination of the letters 'u' 
  and 'v'). Each point on the hyperbolic curve represents an event's space and 
  time measurements made from a different point of view- its observer's frame 
  of reference. Accordingly, the conventional notion for the progress of time 
  will simply move the hyperbola for a subsequent identical event up along a line 
  in the middle of the cut but reversing its direction. In contrast, a duplicate 
  (simultaneous) event further along the line-of-sight will have its hyperbola 
  displaced sideways. However, simultaneous events in other directions will yield 
  hyperbolas rotated with respect to each other (about an axis down the middle 
  of the cut) and, should the events be otherwise identical (and at a right angle 
  to the line-of-sight), they will together form a concave bowl not unlike a satellite 
  receiver dish. Of course we must remember that the hyperbolic Einstein interval 
  is the composite interface between space and time and not a tangible space-time 
  quantity that can be observed on its own, it is calculated from its separately 
  measured space and time components.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">In this 
  discussion we introduced the notion that time has a dimensional quality like 
  space, this raises the issue how its effect on the hyperbola might be visualised. 
  We begin by rotating the hyperbola in the direction of the line-of-sight, i.e. 
  the vertical line assigned to time (down the middle of the hyperbola) revolves 
  like the spokes of a wheel that is at a right angle to the horizontal line whose 
  direction is associated with space. The result of the rotation is a three-dimensional 
  object that resembles the curved surface around the hole of a life-saver (or 
  that of an inner tube), i.e. its surface does not curve in on itself but continues 
  outward like that of a two-way funnel. The difference with the earlier visualisations 
  which concerned other events in space or at other times on our conventional 
  clock is that the 'life-saver' concerns a single event, in other words alternate 
  realities of which we are able to choose only one. The allusion to the wheel 
  also shows how time remains as if at a right angle to space regardless of the 
  angle of rotation, like each of the spokes is perpendicular to the axle, meaning 
  regardless which of the alternate realities we experience time will appear to 
  be at a right angle to space.</font></p>
